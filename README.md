# screen-melter

The code (as many similar), based off of [Napalm's original](http://www.rohitab.com/discuss/topic/23191-screen-melter/?p=190669).
However, many (if any) do not implement **multi-monitor support** and **dpi awareness**, which ruin the effect. This version does. Plus, I added some **args** too.

### Args:

- Sleep time before visual effect (ms): `-t`, `--time` Example: `-t 2000`, `--time=2000`
- The program closes automatically after this amount of time (ms): `-e`, `--exit_time` Example: `-e 10000`, `--exit_time=10000`
- Disable user input: `-I,--disable_input` (ctrl+alt+del still works)
- Disable keyboard: `-K,--disable_keyboard` (ctrl+alt+del still works)
- Disable mouse: `-M,--disable_mouse`
- Start on boot: `-B,--start_on_boot` (program will launch with provided args)

**E.g:**

- `screen-melter.exe -M --disable_keyboard -t 20 --exit_time=10000`
- `screen-melter.exe -B "-t 2000 --exit_time=10000"`
